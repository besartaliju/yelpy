NOTE!: I had a very weird problem trying to push add everything to git hub via terminal, so I just uploaded the files by dragging and dropping on github. As a result, the xcodeproj and xcodeworkspace are .zip files. Unzipping with allow to see my businessviewcontroller and storyboard.
# Project 3 - *Yelpy*

**Yelpy** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss if anyone had a similar problem with pushing and adding from terminal.
2. Navigation Controllers embedded in one another.

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This app didn't entertain me too much. Maybe it's because this was a rough weekend with me for the workload. But I didn't find making a Yelp client entertaining. Also, I had a plethora of problems with git in this project.
